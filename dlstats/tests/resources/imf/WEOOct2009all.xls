Fiscal assumptions: Projections for 2009 are based on the 2009 budget, fiscal stimulus measures announced since the budget was passed, and a cyclical widening of the deficit. These amount to a fiscal stimulus of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and an additional fiscal stimulus of 10.5 percent of GDP in 2010. Over the medium term, the path of health expenditures accelerates as a result of population aging, and costs increase because significant health care reform measures have not been taken.

Official data are only available from 2000. Staff has estimated data prior to 2000 using growth rates from the October 2007 release of WEO. However, there are inconsistencies between staff estimates and other data sources. Therefore, these estimates should be treated as very provisional.

Fiscal assumptions: The fiscal projections assume that fiscal stimulus will be implemented in 2009 and 2010, as announced by the government. These discretionary stimulus measures amount to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2010. Expenditure numbers for 2009 correspond to the budget numbers (original plus supplementary). Revenue projections reflect the IMF staff?s macroeconomic assumptions, adjusted for the estimated costs of tax measures included in the stimulus package. The medium-term projections assume that the government will resume its consolidation plans and balance the budget (excluding social security funds) over the years.
